# Talons In Twilight
Talons in Twilight is a HOI4 Mod where a German Republic led Democratic Faction attempts to resist the crypto-fascist USA and their aims to become the dominant nation of the world, while both simultaneously seek to keep the communists of East Asia contained.

This project uses a React + Vite setup, and Firebase as the main auth provider. 

To any web developers looking through this repo who know their craft:
I'm a very amateur developer, hence you will see a whole bunch of unoptimized code and stuff that probably does not make sense. All of this somehow works and I cannot be bothered to optimize or rewrite the codebase because I'm a very busy man juggling multiple projects while dealing with schoolwork. Also this does not have TailwindCSS. I know, super unoptimized and hard to read, but the fact is that I don't have the time to learn Tailwind syntax, and that vanilla CSS is easier to read for me. I may learn this soon, or not.
