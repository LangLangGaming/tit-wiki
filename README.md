# Talons In Twilight
Talons in Twilight is a Scenario where a German Republic led Democratic Faction attempts to resist the crypto-fascist USA and their aims to become the dominant nation of the world, while both simultaneously seek to keep the communists of East Asia contained.

This timeline diverged from ours in 1919, where instead of forcing Austria to remain separate from Germany, they were allowed to unify. This had triggered France to become an ally of the anti-Versailles Italy, and subsequently, Britain had become allies with Germany in attempts to maintain the status quo in Europe.

The war had quickly escalated from a local European conflict to a world war, as chains of alliances manage to get Japan aligned with Britain and Germany, which subsequently brings America into the conflict on the side of the French and Italians. (You can watch the entirety of the Second World War in the Project Stresa Movie)

After a long battle, the Americans were forced to sign a ceasefire with the Germans and British, splitting the empire of Britain between an Edwardian rival government and the mainland under George, as well as France and Italy being split into northern and southern regions. This democratic force against American foreign interests, as well as the communist movement continuing to exist in East Asia has led to the rise of Lindenberg to presidency, who seeks to malform the American Constitution to ensure he and his clique reign over the republic, and the world.

Will the American led CATO, a mishmash of Crypto-Fascists and fringe nationalists manage to become the hegemons of Europe? Or will the German led ADN unite Europe under progressive democracies? Will the German's "Volksbund" policy of elevating minority Germans in foreign nations be used for good, or evil? Will Russia be united under the German Collaborators, or the Soviet Remnants? And will the UESR survive the potential invasion from both the ADN and CATO?

You decide the future of the world in Talons in Twilight!
