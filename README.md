# Talons In Twilight
Talons in Twilight is a HOI4 Mod where a German Republic led Democratic Faction attempts to resist the crypto-fascist USA and their aims to become the dominant nation of the world, while both simultaneously seek to keep the communists of East Asia contained.

This project uses a React + Vite setup, and Firebase as the main auth/backend provider. 

## WEB DEVELOPER SECTION
To any web developers looking through this repo who know their craft (and are offended by the horrendous code):
I'm a very amateur developer and a beginner at React. This site is meant as a platform for me to learn new things and practices, which will help me make better websites in the future. Hence, you will see very unoptimized and crappy code in this repo, or things that might not be considered best practice. I welcome any sort of constructive criticism; you can contact me through my Discord (@langlanggaming).

Regarding the absence of TailwindCSS in this codebase:
I know many seasoned developers might berate me for not using Tailwind, as it is normally the recommended framework for UI design. However, I have chosen to not use it, simply because I have not fully mastered its syntax. Learning it while doing this might take too much time and be more confusing than regular CSS, and I wanted to get a barebones working version out to the devs so that writing can actually commence. I might rewrite the entire codebase to fit Tailwind later on, but it is not a main priority for me now. If you want to take on the challenge of rewriting it, you are welcome to create a pull request to do so. 


## How to view the site
*This is a very simplified instruction, as I do not know if I have missed any steps. In the unfortunate event that I do, please do shoot me a message, so that I may fix the error. (Or, you could just make a PR but I'm not sure if you can edit this README file or not.)*
This project requires Node.js, which you can find [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
1) First, clone the repo using ```git clone```
2) In VSC, run ```npm run dev``` in the terminal. This will start a local development server, which is needed for dynamic sites like this.
3) You've done it! 

*[ANNOUNCEMENT TO BE POSTED]*
# The Talons In Twilight Website Announcement!
Today, the Talons In Twilight team is proud to announce its new upcoming website! 

## Features:
**Custom-built wiki system**
The main purpose of the website is the wiki, meant as a platform to document the mod's many features, and serve as a memory refresher for the lore. (We highly suggest checking out LoreDad's Project Stressa series to see how this timeline evolved to its current state)

**Developer Diaries**
Before, dev diaries were posted on Discord in the form of Google Docs. On release, all dev diaries will be posted on this website, to streamline the reading experience and make all diaries easily accessible. 

## Release Date:
An official release is expected to happen in Jan-Feb 2026. As of 26th December, the site is under heavy development and is not stable. An official announcement will be made through our social media platforms as well as Discord when the time comes.
