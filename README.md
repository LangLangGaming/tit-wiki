# Talons In Twilight
Talons in Twilight is a HOI4 Mod where a German Republic led Democratic Faction attempts to resist the crypto-fascist USA and their aims to become the dominant nation of the world, while both simultaneously seek to keep the communists of East Asia contained.

This project uses a React + Vite setup, and Firebase as the main auth provider. 

To any web developers looking through this repo who know their craft:
I'm a very amateur developer, hence you will see a whole bunch of unoptimized code and stuff that probably does not make sense. All of this somehow works and I cannot be bothered to optimize or rewrite the codebase because I'm a very busy man juggling multiple projects while dealing with schoolwork. Also this does not have TailwindCSS. I know, super unoptimized and hard to read, but the fact is that I don't have the time to learn Tailwind syntax, and that vanilla CSS is easier to read for me. I may learn this soon, or not. 

## How to view site
*This is a very simplified instruction as I do not know if I have missed any steps. In the unfortunate event that I do, please do shoot me a message, so that I may fix the error. (Or, you could just make a PR but I'm not sure if you can edit this README file or not.)*
This project requires Node.js, which you can find [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
1) First, clone the repo using ```git clone```
2) In VSC, run ```npm run dev``` in the terminal. This will start a local development server, which is needed for dynamic sites like this.
3) You've done it! 

*[ANNOUNCEMENT TO BE POSTED]*
# The Talons In Twiight Website Announcement!
Today, the Talons In Twilight team is proud to announce its new upcoming website! 

## Features:
**Custom-built wiki system**
The main purpose of the website is the wiki, meant as a platform to document the mod's many features, and serve as a memory refresher for the lore. (We highly suggest checking out LoreDad's Project Stressa series to see how this timeline evolved to its current state)

**Developer Diaries**
Before, dev diaries were posted on Discord in the form of Google Docs. On release, all dev diaries will be posted on this website, to streamline the reading experience and make all diaries easily accessible. 

## Release Date:
There will be two release dates, as described below. 

**Alpha Release (For Devs)**
Currently, access to the website is limited to one person (@LangLangGaming, the developer) only. On Alpha Release, access will be granted to all active developers working on the mod, allowing them to begin writing the pages. This also serves as a bug-testing session, allowing us to fix any bugs before the public gets ahold of them. 

**Public Release (v1.0.0)**
This is the official public release, scheduled to happen early/mid January 2026.
